```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

# Read in the data using read_csv() with here(), store as mack_verts

```{r}
mack_verts <- read_csv(here("data", "AS00601.csv"))

mack_verts

mack_verts <- mack_verts %>% clean_names()

mack_verts

```


# In a new code chunk, practice accessing individual pieces of the data frame (there is no real functionality to this, but just to reinforce stuff we learned in our interactive session):

```{r}
mc_wt_5 <- mack_verts$weight[5]
mc_wt_5
```

# Store the 8th - 20th value in the “LENGTH1” column as mc_length_8_20
```{r}
mc_length_8_20 <- mack_verts$length1[8:20]
mc_length_8_20
```


Store everything in column SAMPLEDATE as a vector called mc_dates
```{r}
mc_dates <- mack_verts$sampledate
mc_dates
```
